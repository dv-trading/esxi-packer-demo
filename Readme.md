### Open up vnc ports on host

The firewall blocks vnc ports by default, add a rule for packer

#### `/etc/vmware/firewall/service.xml`

``` xml
<service id="1000">
  <id>packer-vnc</id>
  <rule id="0000">
    <direction>inbound</direction>
    <protocol>tcp</protocol>
    <porttype>dst</porttype>
    <port>
      <begin>5900</begin>
      <end>6000</end>
    </port>
  </rule>
  <enabled>true</enabled>
  <required>true</required>
</service>
```

note: *you may need to change the permissions of the file to edit it*

## Configure `user.json`

Copy `default.user.json` to `user.json` and override the values as appropriate,
here's some documentation for the json properties

``` yaml
{
# The name of the vm and vmdks
    "name": "New VM",
# The network to connect to ethernet0
    "network": "network-local",
# Number of vcpus to allocate for the vm
    "numvcpus": "1",
# Amount of memory needed
    "memsize": "512",
# size of primary harddisk to create
    "disk_size": "40000",
# ssh username for logging into esxi
    "esxi_username": "user",
# ssh password for logging into esxi
    "esxi_password": "password",
# esxi host to log into
    "esxi_host": "<esxi hostname>",
# esxi datastore to use for cache and hard disk
    "esxi_datastore": "datastore"
}
```

## Execute `packer`

execute packer command, and watch output, when the install completes successfully,
the vm will be halted on esxi server and packer will exit successfully when the
installation completes.

``` sh
./provision
```
